## Organization License Creation

### Overview
Super administrators can now create organization licenses through a streamlined process that automatically:
- Generates unique organization subdomains
- Creates superadmin accounts with temporary passwords
- Sets up trial organization licenses
- Sends confirmation emails (when email service is configured)

### API Endpoint
```
POST /api/v1/organizations/license/create
```

### Request Body
```json
{
  "organization_name": "Company Name Ltd",
  "superadmin_email": "admin@company.com"
}
```

### Response
```json
{
  "message": "Organization license created successfully",
  "organization_id": 123,
  "organization_name": "Company Name Ltd",
  "superadmin_email": "admin@company.com",
  "subdomain": "companynameltd",
  "temp_password": "Ab3x9kL2mN5p"
}
```

### Frontend Integration
- Accessible via "Create Organization License" button in the Mega Menu (super admins only)
- Modal-based form with validation
- Success display with all relevant details
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

## Enhanced Authentication Flow

### Multi-Step Login Process
The login system now supports progressive enhancement with the following flow:

1. **Initial Authentication** (Password or OTP)
2. **Password Change** (if required)
3. **Company Details** (for first-time logins)
4. **Dashboard Access**

### Token Enhancement
Login responses now include additional metadata:
```json
{
  "access_token": "jwt_token_here",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "organization_id": 123,
  "organization_name": "Company Name",
  "user_role": "org_admin",
  "must_change_password": true,
  "is_first_login": false
}
```

### OTP Authentication
- Simple in-memory OTP service for testing/demo
- 6-digit OTP codes with 5-minute expiration
- Maximum 3 attempts per OTP
- OTP logging for development/testing

## Password Management

### Password Change
Users can change their passwords through:
- Settings page (voluntary)
- Mandatory change prompts (after OTP login or first login)

#### API Endpoint
```
POST /api/v1/auth/password/change
```

#### Request Body
```json
{
  "current_password": "old_password",
  "new_password": "new_secure_password"
}
```

### Forgot Password Flow
Multi-step password reset process:

1. **Request Reset**: User enters email
2. **OTP Verification**: User receives and enters OTP
3. **Password Reset**: User sets new password

#### API Endpoints
```
POST /api/v1/auth/password/forgot
POST /api/v1/auth/password/reset
```
